### Project Vision

Students, Staff, and Organizations all need to manage financial aid. This solution endeavors to supply Financial Aid architecture and small assistance in a manner similar to EDA. For use by Institutions that want to manage Financial Aid funding data.

### Project Resources (It's ok if you'd prefer to type all the things in Google docs, Quip, or your word processor of choice, just please make sure you include links to your work here in Github. We need a source of truth, and for now that's here in GitHub.)
