### Project Vision

**Virtual March/April 2020:** Building off of the efforts of the 2019 Philly Sprint. This App is meant to support all means of finances for Students and Faculty. It focuses on tracking financing such as scholarships, grants, etc. as the first piece of the App. 

The Appâ€™s main goals are to:

*   Track and Communicate Financing opportunities to Students, Faculty, and Advisors
*   Allow Students to see their Financial Aid funding and what other funds they need to complete their financial obligations
*   Allow the Educational Institution to report on details of Financing per department, type of student, etc.
*   Match students who meet criteria to available Financing opportunities 

**Philly 2019:**
Students, Staff, and Organizations all need to manage financial aid. This solution endeavors to supply Financial Aid architecture and small assistance in a manner similar to EDA. For use by Institutions that want to manage Financial Aid funding data.

### Project Resources

### Current Project Team Accomplishments

What did the Project Team get done during the Sprint?

**Virtual March/April 2020:**
During this Sprint we broadened the existing schema to include all financing options. We thought through the solution as a whole to see what parts of EDA we could work with to make it easier to use existing pieces. 

We also began discussions with the Outbound Funds team to see if their App/Schema is a good match for our project and whether Financial Aid could be an add-on package similar to NPSP.

### Project Team Accomplishments (YTD)

In October 2019, the project team created a schema and an outline of some setup guides

### Contributing

See the [Issues](https://github.com/SFDO-Sprint-2019-Philadelphia/Financial-Aid/issues) tab for open enhancements. Feel free to add additional suggestions and use cases!

### Project Roadmap

*   Finish reviewing all Outbound Funds objects and workflows
*   Discuss with OF the opportunity to adjust objects/etc for this app
*   Build Tracking schema and rules
*   Use EDA schema to set up tuition/course costs in order to track remaining funds
